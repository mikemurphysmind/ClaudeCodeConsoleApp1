# Claude Code Console Test App 1

## Synopsis

This project is a simple C# .NET 8.0 console application that demonstrates programmatic logging using log4net. It initializes log4net to write log messages to a rolling log file in a dedicated Log directory. The application outputs a greeting message to the console and logs the same message to the log file. This setup is useful for learning or testing logging frameworks and basic console app structure in .NET.
